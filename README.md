Overview:
The Racket Computational Toolkit is a collection of Racket functions aimed at solving a variety of computational and logical problems using functional programming paradigms. This project demonstrates the application of mathematical computations, data handling, and logical reasoning through Racket programming.

Features:
•	Mathematical Computations: Implement functions such as lowest-exponent to find the smallest exponent where the base raised to the exponent is at least as large as a given bound, and divisors to compute all divisors of a number.
•	Data Handling and Manipulation: Analyze and manipulate data structures like lists and strings. Includes functions to check if elements in a list are in increasing order and to modify the case of vowels in strings.
•	Logical Reasoning: Solve complex problems efficiently using recursion, high-order functions, and lambda expressions. Functions handle tasks like determining abundant numbers and assessing order within lists.
